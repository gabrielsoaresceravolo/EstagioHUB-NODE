### Description about the repository

This repository was created to learn how to manage projects using Node.js. It encompasses two main purposes:

* **Book Sales Project:** This module of the project is dedicated to creating a book sales system. It includes functionalities such as login control and access, as well as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that perform insertions into the Firebase database. The routes are configured based on each screen of the system, providing intuitive and organized navigation.

* **Internship Management Project:** This module focuses on internship management, offering a platform for controlling and monitoring interns. Similar to the book sales project, it also incorporates login control and access logics, as well as CRUD operations with Firebase and route configuration based on the different screens of the system.

Both projects work with a robust structure to ensure the security and efficiency of operations, facilitating the learning and practice of project management in Node.js.
